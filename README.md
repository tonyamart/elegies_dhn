The folder *data* includes the table with the corpus of elegies provided with metadata (*elegies_corpus.tsv*). The tables named as MFW50-300_???.tsv comprises word frequencies for words from elegies corpus (class 'EL'), corpus of Russian songs (class 'RS') and the poetic subcorpus of Russian National corpus (classes: 'NE' or 'NS' for non-elegy and non-song respectively) which were used for the SVM classification tests. The tables *TM_beta.tsv* and *TM_gamma.tsv* are the values extracted from the topic model.

The examples of how the data were (pre)processed and visualized are in the sections *scripts* and *figures*.

The full dataset (509 elegies and metadata) is published on the Dataverse: [Martynenko, Antonina, 2020, Corpus of Russian elegies](https://doi.org/10.31860/openlit-2019.11-C001)
